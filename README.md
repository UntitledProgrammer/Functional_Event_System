# Functional Event System
>**Introduction:**  
>Here you will find a simplified event-style system that operates by the use of delegates. When a method or function is 'subscribed', it is stored according to the event type that will invoke it. The 'event-type' also defines the parameter that will be passed to the method/function upon an event occurrence.
